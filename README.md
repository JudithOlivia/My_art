What it is: I made an art portfolio of my digital and traditional artwork.
Why I made it: I made it to show my artwork.
How I made it: I sed HTML and CSS.

What I struggled with: 
- The time: I had a small timeframe to finish this piece so I had to rush it.
- The image size: When I put the image in, the image was too big. Turns out, it was a symple fix and all I had to do was add in highth and width.
