                <p>• My personal favourite because of how realistic it looks.🩷🩷</p>
                <p>• My favourite part is the detail in the body and around the eye.</p>
                <p>• If I could change one thing, it would be the background because it doesn't blend in with the drawing.🌿 </p>
                <p>• This piece took me a week.</p>

                <p>• The hardest part was drawing her face and getting her expression right</p>
                <p>• If I could change one thing, I would remove the pink airbrush outline around her.🩷</p>

                <p>• My favourite part was drawing the highlighters and pens in the cup and the scarf around the penguin.</p>
                <p>• What I don't like about it: The bottom of the cup looks like it if floating.</p>
                <p>• It is a ceamic cup and I tried my best to show that.</p>
